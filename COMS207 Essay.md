# Introduction
In his 1999 article, *Database as Symbolic Form*, Lev Manovich (Manovich, 1999) called database the key form of cultural expression in the computer age. 

In this essay, we will look at what databases are, and their relation to 


# What is Database?
Databases are increasingly the dominant form of new media.  From Google to the way we get our morning news, databases underly most of the daily functions we take for granted.  For all their ubiquity, however, databases are widely misunderstood.  In its simplest form, a database is "A computer-based collection of logically related records or files organized in such a way that it can easily be accessed and maintained." [^oxford]  Most computer systems use databases to store data, which is manipulated with various algorithms.  One of the foremost properties of databases, especially in the context of new media, is the ability to display the same information in various formats, without changing the data itself.  An example of this is a simple Google search - when we search for a simple search term, the web page we see is only a view of the database, manipulated by special algorithms.  If a different user searched for the same term, a different view might appear, depending on what the Google algorithm determines is relevant for that user.  If the page is accessed on a mobile device, in a different language, or with user style sheets, the view will be formatted differently.  To summarise, databases tend to have two properties.  Firstly, they store data without a specific order or logic. (Manovich, 1999)  Secondly, databased media tend to divorce the interface from the data itself.  

The absolute ubiquity of databases makes them tricky to pin down.  Database forms of media stretch back a long time.  Manovich argues that one of the first database media were encyclopaedias created by the ancient Greeks [^mavovich] (Mavovich, 1999).  Because database form media (an encyclopaedia) and narrative form media (a novel) can both be represented in the same medium (a book), it is clear databased media is not unique to technology: however, as Manovich also raises in his work, this present age of computers and the internet does seem to favour the database as a media form.  

The first large scale, technology based database was the 1890 US census  [^driscoll] (Driscoll, 2012)  This used punched cards, which meant data could be accessed and sorted more easily - individual records could be accessed, rather than scrolling through books or pages to find a person's data.  Slowly, over the next 30 years, more businesses started to adopt custom database solutions.  One of the early concerns around this new database technology was the divide between database and narrative - society worried that if people were reduced to entries in a database, rather than people with stories and relations with clerks, they would be dehumanised and treated worse. (Driscoll, 2012)  Towards the 1960s and onwards, databases enjoyed a more favourable public opinion, as personal computers allowed the general public to utilise databases for simple day to day tasks.  Over the next few decades as technology improved, databases became more powerful and drove more and more technology.  Many technical changes have occurred over the past few years as large companies such as google, amazon, and twitter have made fortunes on the contents of large databases, but the basic idea is still the same: bits of information stored in a form which 




In this essay, we will look at database forms in contrast to other forms of media, such as narrative.
