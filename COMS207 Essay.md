In his 1999 article, *Database as Symbolic Form*, Lev Manovich (Manovich, 1999) called database the key form of cultural expression in the computer age. 

In this essay, we will look at what databases are, and their relation to 


# What is Database?
Databases are increasingly the dominant form of new media.  From Google to the way we get our morning news, databases underly most of the daily functions we take for granted.  For all their ubiquity, however, databases are widely misunderstood.  In its simplest form, a database is "A computer-based collection of logically related records or files organized in such a way that it can easily be accessed and maintained." [^oxford]  Most computer systems use databases to store data, which is manipulated with various algorithms.  One of the foremost properties of databases, especially in the context of new media, is the ability to display the same information in various formats, without changing the data itself.  An example of this is a simple Google search - when we search for a simple search term, the web page we see is only a view of the database, manipulated by special algorithms.  If a different user searched for the same term, a different view might appear, depending on what the Google algorithm determines is relevant for that user.  If the page is accessed on a mobile device, in a different language, or with user style sheets, the view will be formatted differently.  To summarise, databases tend to have two properties.  Firstly, they store data without a specific order or logic. (Manovich, 1999)  Secondly, databased media tend to divorce the interface from the data itself.  

The absolute ubiquity of databases makes them tricky to pin down.  Database forms of media stretch back a long time.  Manovich argues that one of the first database media were encyclopaedias created by the ancient Greeks [^mavovich] (Mavovich, 1999).  Because database form media (an encyclopaedia) and narrative form media (a novel) can both be represented in the same medium (a book), it is clear databased media is not unique to technology: however, as Manovich also raises in his work, this present age of computers and the internet does seem to favour the database as a media form.  

The first large scale, technology based database was the 1890 US census  [^driscoll] (Driscoll, 2012)  This used punched cards, which meant data could be accessed and sorted more easily - individual records could be accessed, rather than scrolling through books or pages to find a person's data.  Slowly, over the next 30 years, more businesses started to adopt custom database solutions.  One of the early concerns around this new database technology was the divide between database and narrative - society worried that if people were reduced to entries in a database, rather than people with stories and relations with clerks, they would be dehumanised and treated worse. (Driscoll, 2012)  Towards the 1960s and onwards, databases enjoyed a more favourable public opinion, as personal computers allowed the general public to utilise databases for simple day to day tasks.  Over the next few decades as technology improved, databases became more powerful and drove more and more technology.  Many technical changes have occurred over the past few years as large companies such as google, amazon, and twitter have made fortunes on the contents of large databases, but the basic idea is still the same: bits of information stored in a form 

One of the key attributes of databases is that *they are what you make of them*.  Since the data is unstructured, it could be argued that it really only takes on meaning depending on queries performed on it, and how it is displayed.  This is similar to the concept of hypertextuality, or writerly text. [^allen] (Allen, 2011) This concept states that the value of text is in the connections between texts, which the reader makes as they follow trails of thought.    *finish*

In this essay, we will look at database forms in contrast to other forms of media, such as narrative.  

# Where do database and narrative overlap?
Lev Manovich believes that both database and narrative are "two basic creative impulses, two essential responses to the world" (Manovich, 1999).  Although they are both separate and distinct, they are both important in making sense of the world and ordering information.

One example strikingly shows the difference, and yet the similarity of the two approaches.  The Oxford English Dictionary is one of the world's most authoritative sources on the English language ("About", n.d.).  It is most certainly a database - it is accessed randomly and it contains data which can be viewed in different ways (oed.com, The Oxford English Dictionary, The Pocket Oxford English Dictionary).  Recently, the Oxford English Dictionary started an appeal on their website to "Help record the history of our language" ("Appeals", n.d.) [^appeals].  In it, they ask for people's help to map the morphing of the English language, by providing evidence for the earliest use of specific words.  Users submit examples of usage from literature, and though that, they can build a profile of word use over time.  The fascinating thing about this, is that the Oxford English Dictionary is *building a database out of a narrative*.  Words make up the literature submitted, which are formed by the author into narrative: a story, a play, or a biography.  The Oxford English Dictionary, however, treats as these words as database entries. This shows an overlap between database form and narrative form in everyday use.

Broader than this example, however, is the concept of hypertextuality.  With hypertextuality, the efficacy of the 

Roland Barthes argued that any text written is "a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture" [^barthes] (Barthes, 1977: 146) If this is true, no text is unique, and instead effectively draws items from a database of cultural ideas.  While no physical database like this exists, it doesn't negate the fact that the medium of narrative does draw heavily from the medium of database.  Lev Manovich takes this further in relation to film: he states that "cinema already exists right in the intersection between database and narrative" (Manovich, 1999) [^manovich].  He comes to this position because of the editing process: footage is shot for a film, and is entered into a database.  This database contains hundreds of clips, which are in order of shooting.  Since logistical concerns dictate the order of filming, these clips are not in a narrative order.  During the editing process, the editor, under the direction of the film's director, takes this database and arranges the clips into a finished film.  Since many different films could conceivably be created from the same database of clips, the finished film is a by-product from the database.


# How do they differ
One of the biggest advantages of databased media is the ability to create mashups (Miller, 2011) [^miller].  A mashup is a remix or a modification of an original work, such as sampling a gospel hook in a rap album, or adding intentionally wrong 'lip read' subtitles to parts of a movie.  A more limited definition is given by the Encyclopedia of Database Systems (Wun, 2009) [^wun] as a "web application that combines data from multiple sources, creating a new hybrid web application".  Many database owners allow public access into their data through an "application programming interface" (API).  This means that developers can build apps which use this data in new ways, such as plotting known free wifi spots over a map of London [^wifi] ("Free Wifi & Plugs")  Although there are legal issues associated with this, it is still an interesting issue to observe
